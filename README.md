# iOS developer assessment

Hello developer! ðŸ™Œ

Are you ready to be the next Dynamate (this is how we kindly call our fantastic team members)?

This is our iOS Developer assessment test. Please read carefully the instructions below:


## Introduction

As part of the recruitment process weâ€™d like you to complete a short development assignment, so that we can get a feel for your coding level and a better understanding of what it would be like to work with you.

## Task

Develop an application that allows a user to:
- See the list of all SpaceX rocket launches
- Select a launch from the list and display a small amount of information about
  the launch, including displaying the date, location, rocket name, launch patch
image, etc. 

Use the SpaceX API described here:  https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs/v4

The application should make use of the REST API. However, it should not simply fetch all the data once, rather ensure that the app displays fresh data, so that it is always up-to-date as long as there is a data connection. Although itâ€™s a simple project, please treat the task as you would a real app, so that the true quality of your work is reflected in what you submit for us to review.

Prefer to do it in MVP or MVVM architecture. If you can write testable code, it is even better.

## Further details

Please complete the task in Swift, utilizing iOS best practices and  default design elements. Return the assignment in the form of an iOS project. A zip file is okay but access to a remote repository is better. If you would like to discuss the task in more detail, feel free to get in touch. Likewise, if you would like some advice or would like to discuss your approach, weâ€™re happy to do that via email or a phone call.

If you are unable to complete the assignment, do what you can and briefly describe what else you could do or what you are having problems with. A known issues list or plan for further development may also be included but is not a requirement of the task.

Have fun!ðŸ‘‹
